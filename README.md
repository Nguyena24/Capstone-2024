# Capstone
 
##Andrew Nguyen

This Capstone is an attempt to use Unity to create a realistic Ultimate Frisbee Simulator using genetic algorithms and my own physics engine that can also be translated to other sports. This project is also in collaboration with Carter Horton who's project is based around observing flight patterns of frisbees in real life. Using Carter's data I can make my simulator more accurate to real life, and this same strategy could be used across other sports (observing their movement and reactions in real life to translate to a 3D simulator).
