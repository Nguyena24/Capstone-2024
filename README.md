# Capstone
 
##Andrew Nguyen

This Capstone is an attempt to use Unity to create a realistic Ultimate Frisbee Simulator using genetic algorithms and my own physics engine that can also be translated to other sports. This project is also in collaboration with Carter Horton who's project is based around observing flight patterns of frisbees in real life. Using Carter's data I can make my simulator more accurate to real life, and this same strategy could be used across other sports (observing their movement and reactions in real life to translate to a 3D simulator).

For this project I plan to begin by making a 3D simulator within Unity of a player throwing a frisbee using the physics engine that is already being used by Unity. Once a rudimentary simulator is made, I will use a self-made genetic algorithm that uses the data of a frisbee being thrown in real life as it's "solution" to generate exact position values for the frisbee to fly along. Then I can use this data to make a physics engine to implement within my original 3D simulator to make it more accurate. This process can be done to generate exact values for multiple different types of throws.
